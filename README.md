# practice repo
This is my practice repository. There is no real code here. Just some random code that I create in order to enhance my knowledge and learn.

The purpose of this repository serves as what the name is... practice. I will learn something, make code out of it, in turn, enhancing and expanding what I have learned from before.

Feel free to make fun of it, since there more than likely will be code that should be easier than what I make it to be.
